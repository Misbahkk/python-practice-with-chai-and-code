# Memory representation
- always remmber that when we create a variable so our data stire in memory si firstly data store in memory and then assign any variabale. 
- all data type is store in memory. vo variable pa nh jata.
- we never say that this variable is int , string etc. 
- always we say the data that store in memory that you are the this data type and this variable refrence you.

<p>In python not any data type for varible but in memory the refrence have data type</p>


# 1. What is an Object?
<p > in Python, everything is an object. Whether it’s a simple integer, a list, or even a function, all data types are objects. This is one of the fundamental principles of Python: everything is an object.</p>

- When you create a variable, Python creates an object for that value in memory.

# 2. What is a Reference?
<p color='red'>A reference is like a pointer or a label that points to the location in memory where the object exists. <br> - When you assign a value to a variable, <br>- that variable is not the object itself, <br>- it’s a reference to that object in memory.</p>
